# Exceptions aren't always errors - pg 1146
# In Python, all errors are exceptions, but not all exceptions are errors.
#   Example, EOFError


# Functions can signal conditions with raise - pg 1147
    
# By wrapping an entire program (or a call to it) in an outer try in your 
# top-level code, you can catch any exception that may occur while your
# program runs, thereby subverting the default program termination - pg 1149

# Catching Too Much: Avoid Empty except and Exception - pg 1153
# You many wind up interception an error thats expected by a try handler higher
# up in the exception nesting structure.
# Rule of thumb : Be as specific in your handlers as you can be.

# Catching Too Little: Use Class-Based Categories - pg 1155
# If you catch a general superclass, you can add and raise more specific 
# subclasses in the future without having to extend except clause lists 
# manuallyâ€”the superclass becomes an extendible exceptions category.
